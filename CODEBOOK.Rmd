## Codebook elements provided in the original files:

* ./UCI_HAR_Dataset/features_info.txt

this file lists and gives information on the main measured variables.  

* ./UCI_HAR_Dataset/features.txt

this file provides the names of each one of 561 measured or estimated variables.

* ./UCI_HAR_Dataset/activity_labels.txt

this file provides the names of the different categories of activities for which measurements have been made.

* ./UCI_HAR_Dataset/train/y_train.txt and ./UCI_HAR_Dataset/test/y_test.txt

these 2 files provide an identification code in range [1, 30] to identify each trial participant for each observation.


## About variables related units of measure:

* <ins>For acceleration type variables along an axis:</ins> units of gravity expressed in g.  

* <ins>For other variables (gyroscope angular speed):</ins> unit = gradians / second.


## Modified or added variables during the process for my "tidy data set":
